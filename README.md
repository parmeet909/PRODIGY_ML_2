**Task:**
K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a reatail store based on their purchase history.

**K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation in Retail:**
Welcome to the K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation project! In this repository, we explore how K-means clustering can help retail businesses group their customers based on their purchase history. 
By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and enhance customer experience.

**Introduction:**
Customer segmentation is crucial for understanding the diverse needs and behaviors of retail store customers. 
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique that allows us to group similar customers together.
In this project, we apply K-means to a retail dataset to create meaningful customer segments.

**Methodology:**
1. Data loading and Preprocessing:
   Handle missing values
   Normalize features

2. Feature Selection:
   Choose relevant features for clustering

3. K-Means Clustering:
   Determine the optimal number of clusters (Elbow method)
   Apply K-means algorithm

4. Interpretation:
   Analyze cluster characteristics
   Assign customer segments

**Results:**
Our K-means model identifies distinct customer segments, such as:
High-value shoppers
Occasional buyers
Bargain hunters
